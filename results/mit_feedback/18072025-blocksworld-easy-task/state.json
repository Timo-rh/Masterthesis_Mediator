    "Let me evaluate these types according to the checklist:\n\n1: Are there additional types which are needed to model the domain?\n    No additional types are needed.\n\n2: Are additional types needed for organising the type hierarchy?\n    No meta-types are needed.\n\n3: Are any of the types actually objects?\n    No individual objects are listed as types.\n\n4: Are any of the types actually actions?\n    No actions are listed as types.\n\n5: Are any of the types actually properties?\n    Yes, \"color\" is a property of blocks and should be modelled as a predicate (e.g., \"is_blue ?b - block\") rather than as a type.\n\n6: Is the acting agent itself included?\n    No, the robot arm is correctly not included as a type since there's only one.\n\n7: Will any of the included types only ever be used once?\n    Yes, \"table\" will only ever be used once and should be modelled implicitly.\n\n8: Is the acting agent itself or the resulting plans included?\n    Yes, \"stack\" is not really a type but rather a state that emerges from the relationships between blocks. This should be modelled through predicates like \"on ?b1 ?b2 - block\".\n\nI suggest the following changes:\n- Remove \"color\" as it's a property\n- Remove \"table\" as it should be modelled implicitly\n- Remove \"stack\" as it's a state description\n- Keep only \"block\" as a type\n\nThe domain can be fully modelled with just the \"block\" type, with relationships and properties handled through predicates.",
    "1: Is any child not a subtype of its parent? \n    \"block\" is a type of object, so this is correct. Therefore: No.\n\n2: Is any subtype not a child of its parent type? \n    There are no subtypes among the current types. So: No. \n\n3: Are any new types needed for organisation? \n    The only type is \"block\" and it doesn't have any subtypes, so no organisation is needed. Therefore: No.\n\nNo feedback.",
    "Let me evaluate the actions for this blocks world domain:\n\n1: Are there additional actions needed for this domain?\n    No additional actions are needed. The three actions (pick_up_block, put_down_block_on_table, and stack_block) are sufficient to model all necessary operations in this domain. The robot can pick up blocks that are free (no blocks on top), put them down on the table, or stack them on other blocks.\n\n2: Should any of the actions be split or combined?\n    No. Each action represents an atomic operation that cannot be meaningfully split or combined. The actions are well-defined and distinct.\n\n3: Should any of the actions be removed?\n    No. All three actions are essential for the domain. We need to be able to pick up blocks, put them on the table, and stack them on other blocks.\n\n4: Should any preconditions be changed?\n    No. The preconditions are implicitly well-defined in the descriptions. For pick_up_block, the block must be clear (no blocks on top). For put_down_block_on_table and stack_block, the robot arm must be holding a block. For stack_block, the target block must also be clear.\n\n5: Should any effects be changed?\n    No. The effects are implicit in the action descriptions and are appropriate for the domain.\n\n6: Should any action examples be modified?\n    No. The examples clearly demonstrate the usage of each action with concrete objects.\n\nTherefore: No feedback.\n\nThe actions provided are exactly what's needed for this classical blocks world domain, no more and no less. The domain is intentionally simple and these three actions capture all necessary operations.",
    "Let me analyze each action:\n\n1. pick_up_block:\n1: Missing preconditions? No - it checks the block is clear, either on table or another block, and arm is empty.\n2: Unnecessary preconditions? No - all are needed.\n3: Missing effects? No - updates holding state, arm state, and removes old position.\n4: Unnecessary effects? No - all effects are relevant.\n5: Predicate improvements? No - predicates are clear and well-used.\n6: Symmetrical predicates? No - none are symmetrical.\n\n2. put_down_block_on_table:\n1: Missing preconditions? No - only needs to check holding.\n2: Unnecessary preconditions? No - minimal preconditions used.\n3: Missing effects? No - updates holding, position and clear status.\n4: Unnecessary effects? No - all effects needed.\n5: Predicate improvements? No - predicates are clear.\n6: Symmetrical predicates? No - none are symmetrical.\n\n3. stack_block:\n1: Missing preconditions? No - checks holding, target clear, and blocks different.\n2: Unnecessary preconditions? No - all checks needed.\n3: Missing effects? Yes - should add Predicate_Instance(name=\"arm_empty\", parameters=[]) to effects.\n4: Unnecessary effects? No - all effects relevant.\n5: Predicate improvements? No - predicates well defined.\n6: Symmetrical predicates? No - none are symmetrical.\n\nThe only issue is in stack_block where the arm_empty predicate should be added to effects since the arm is no longer holding anything after stacking. The effects should be:\n\n```\neffects = {\n    \"and\": [\n        Predicate_Instance(name=\"on\", parameters=[\"block\", \"target\"]),\n        Condition(type=\"not\", conditions=Predicate_Instance(name=\"holding\", parameters=[\"block\"])),\n        Predicate_Instance(name=\"clear\", parameters=[\"block\"]),\n        Predicate_Instance(name=\"arm_empty\", parameters=[])\n    ]\n}\n```",

      "The initial state is missing several crucial predicates. While we correctly specify what each block is on, we also need to specify which blocks are clear (have nothing on top of them). Based on the description, we need to add:\n- Predicate_Instance(name='clear', parameters=['blue_block'])\n- Predicate_Instance(name='clear', parameters=['green_block'])",
      "The goal state should include more predicates. While we specify that the red block should be on the green block, we should also ensure that:\n1. The arm is empty at the end: Predicate_Instance(name='arm_empty', parameters=[])\n2.
