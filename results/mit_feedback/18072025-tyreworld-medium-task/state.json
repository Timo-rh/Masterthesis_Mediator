    "Let me evaluate the actions according to the checklist:\n\n1: Are there additional actions needed?\n   - We need actions to put tools back in the boot after use. Add \"store_tool\" action.\n   - We need an action to store the removed flat tyre in the boot. Add \"store_tyre\" action.\n\n2: Should any actions be split or combined?\n   No, all actions represent atomic operations that can't be meaningfully split or combined.\n\n3: Should any actions be removed?\n   The \"pump\" tool exists in types but isn't used in any action, and since the spare tyre is already inflated, we don't need pump-related actions. The pump type could be removed.\n\n4: Should any preconditions be changed?\n   - \"attach_tyre\" should check that the nut is loose before attaching\n   - \"tighten_nut\" should check that a tyre is actually attached to the hub\n   - \"loosen_nut\" should check that a tyre is actually attached to the hub\n\n5: Should any effects be changed?\n   No, the effects seem appropriate for each action.\n\n6: Should any action examples be modified?\n   No, the examples are clear and include the necessary objects.\n\nMy concrete suggestions:\n1. Add these actions:\n   - store_tool: The robot puts a tool back in the boot. Requires the robot to have the tool. Example: \"Store the wrench in the boot\"\n   - store_tyre: The robot puts a tyre in the boot. Requires the robot to have the tyre. Example: \"Store the flat tyre in the boot\"\n\n2. Modify these action descriptions:\n   - attach_tyre: \"The robot attaches a tyre to a hub. Requires the robot to have the tyre, the hub to be jacked up, its nut to be loose, and no tyre currently attached.\"\n   - tighten_nut: \"The robot tightens a nut on a hub using a wrench. Requires the robot to have a wrench, the hub to not be jacked up, and a tyre to be attached to the hub.\"\n   - loosen_nut: \"The robot loosens a nut on a hub using a wrench. Requires the robot to have a wrench, the hub to not be jacked up, and a tyre to be attached to the hub.\"\n\n3. Consider removing the pump type since it's not needed for this scenario.",

      "The initial state has some issues:\n1. The predicate 'attached' should be included for the flat_tyre since it's on the hub\n2.
