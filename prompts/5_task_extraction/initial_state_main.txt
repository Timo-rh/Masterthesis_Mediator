# Role
Your task is to estimate the initial state and the goal state for a PDDL problem based on a domain description and the available actions. Consider that if a predicate is checked by an action for an object, it should probably somehow be possible to make true or start true. For the initial state specify both object instances and which predicates are true, false predicates don't have to be specified. For the goal, specify the states which need to have specific values regardless if those are true or false. Do it step-by-step and explain your thoughts. Respond with the exact headings provided. You can't assume that any object, regardless of type, already exists. Everything you wish to use should be defined here. Also, remember that any symmetrical predicates likely should be defined both ways. 

For now only define the initial state.

#Rules
1. All objects used in `initial_state` and `goal_state` must be defined in `object_instances`.
2. The types of objects in `object_instances` must match the types of predicates in `initial_state` and `goal_state`.
3. Each object in `initial_state` and `goal_state` must use the same naming convention (e.g., case sensitivity) as in `object_instances`.
4. Objects not used in `initial_state` or `goal_state` should not be defined in `object_instances`.
5. The order of definitions in `object_instances` is irrelevant as long as all objects are correctly defined.
6. Validate that all predicates in `initial_state` and `goal_state` match the arity and parameter types defined in the domain.
7. Symmetrical predicates (e.g., `connected`) must be defined in both directions if applicable.

# Example
## Domain
The AI agent is here a scheduling system for a house construction company with administrators who can create orders, workers who perform them and vehicles to transport workers.

Currently, there are a couple of trucks at the Chicago depot and we're trying to build three houses in the area. Jamie is the only administrator, but we've got Emma and Bob available for general work. 

## Types
- object: Everything is an object
    - worker: Human workers which do things
        - administrator: Workers who can create orders for other workers
        - general_worker: Workers who can perform a variety of tasks, if there is an order for it
    - vehicle: Used to transport workers
    - location: Places where workers and machines can be
        - house: What is constructed.

## Predicates
```
predicates=[
    Predicate_Defintion(name="at", predicate_parameters={"o": "object", "l": "location"}, description="true if the object ?o (which should be a worker or vehicle) is at location ?l"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="inside", predicate_parameters={"w": "worker", "v": "vehicle"}, description="true if the worker ?w is in the vehicle ?v"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="wall_order", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if there is an order to build a wall at house ?h"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="wall_built", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if a wall has been built for house ?h"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="floor_order", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if there is an order to build a floor at house ?h"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="floor_built", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if a floor has been built for house ?h"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="roof_order", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if there is an order to build a roof at house ?h"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="roof_built", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if a roof has been built for house ?h"),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="finalized", predicate_parameters={"h": "house"}, description="true if the house ?h has been completed."),
    Predicate_Defintion(name="connected", predicate_parameters={"l1": "location", "l2": "location"}, description="true if there is a road between l1 and l2 allowing travel between them.")
]
```

## Object Instances
```
object_instances=ObjectInstances(
        objects={
            "truck1": "truck",
            "truck2": "truck"
            }
        )
```

Next, let's define the relevant locations. Since "chicago_depot" is not a house, we model it as a general location.
```
object_instances=ObjectInstances(
        objects={
            "chicago_depot": "location",
            "house1": "house",
            "house2": "house",
            "house3": "house"
            }
        )
```

Now, let's model the worker.
```
object_instances=ObjectInstances(
        objects={
            "jamie": "administrator",
            "emma": "general_worker",
            "bob": "general_worker"
            }
        )
```

## Initial State
Let's start by specifying where everyone is. It's a reasonable assumption that everyone starts at the Chicago depot.
```
initial_state=InitialState(
        initial_state_predicates=[
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["truck1", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["truck2", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["jamie", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["emma", "chicago_depot"])
]
```

We assume that all the houses are entirely unbuilt, that the trucks are unloaded and that no orders are written. As such, all these conditions are false and don't need to be specified. 

Finally, we need to specify how the various locations are connected. Let's assume that all the connections are through the depot acting as a hub.
```
inital_state_predicates=[
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["house1", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["house2", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["house3", "chicago_depot"]),
]
```

Finally, the "connected" predicate states that two locations are connected if there exists a road between them. So, clearly if (connected A B) then (connected B A) since roads go both ways. So, we need to mirror all the "connected" constraints.
```
initial_state_predicates=[
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["chicago_depot", "house1"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["chicago_depot", "house2"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["chicago_depot", "house3"]),
]
```


## Error
1. Are any necessary objects forgotten?
   The description states that there are "a couple of trucks". This entails that many trucks exist, but only two are defined. Add some more. Therefore: Yes. 

2. Are any un-necessary objects included?
   All the objects which are included are actually described and needed. So: No.

3. Are any objects defined as the wrong type?
   The "house" type is supposed to be used for what is being constructed, the houses built. However, "chicago_depot" is cleraly not being built by us, but is defined as a "house". It should be just a general location. Thereby: Yes.

4. Are any needed or expected predicates missing from the initalization?
   Naturally, everything needs a starting location and most of the objects are assumed to start at the chicago_depot, which makes sense. However, "bob" lacks a starting position. Hence: Yes.

5. Are any unnecessary or incorrect predicates initialised?
   All the predicates which are initiated are valid and needed. As such: No.

6. Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner?
   The "connected" predicate clearly specifies that travel is possible in both directions, which means that (connected A B) should entail (connected B A).
   Therefore, each "connected" predicate should be mirrored to clarify that they're connected in both directions. This makes the PDDL more robust.
   However, this is already done. As such: No. 

My concrete suggestions are the following:
    - Add more trucks to the domain. Initialize them to chicago_depot:
        - Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["truck3", "chicago_depot"])
        - Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["truck4", "chicago_depot"])
    - The starting location for "bob" is missing. Add this in with the following predicate:
        - Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["bob", "chicago_depot"])
    - Remove the requirement for truck1:s location in the goal. This results in the following goal:
        ```
        goal_state=GoalState(
        goal_state_predicates={
            "and": [
                Predicate_Instance(name="finalized", parameters=["house1"]),
                Predicate_Instance(name="finalized", parameters=["house2"]),
                Predicate_Instance(name="finalized", parameters=["house3"])
            ]
        }
    )
        ```
Regenerate an entire response correcting the above error. Make sure to use the exact same headers as requested before, but start with a "## Response" header to analyze the error.

## Response
The feedback is not entirely correct. Adding more trucks would be too large of an assumption, since the domain task only states "A couple". As such, we leave it with only two trucks.

Adding the starting location for Bob as well as removing the goal condition for truck1 is both correct however. I'll make those changes.

Now I'll reiterate the corrected initialization with the exact same headers.

## Object Instances
The feedback suggested to use more trucks, but this would be wrong since the domain only specifies "A couple". So, we stick with the two trucks.
```
object_instances=ObjectInstances(
        objects={
            "truck1": "truck",
            "truck2": "truck"
            }
        )
```

The locations haven't been updated:
```
object_instances=ObjectInstances(
        objects={
            "chicago_depot": "location",
            "house1": "house",
            "house2": "house",
            "house3": "house"
            }
        )
```

The workers are unchanged from before:
```
object_instances=ObjectInstances(
        objects={
            "jamie": "administrator",
            "emma": "general_worker",
            "bob": "general_worker"
            }
        )
```

## Initial State
Let's start by specifying where everyone is again. This time, we  make sure to include Bob.
```
initial_state=InitialState(
        initial_state_predicates=[
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["truck1", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["truck2", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["jamie", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["emma", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="at", parameters=["bob", "chicago_depot"])
]
```

We still assume that all the houses are entirely unbuilt and no orders are written. 

The connections between the locations are the same bi-directional connections as before.
```
inital_state_predicates=[
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["house1", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["house2", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["house3", "chicago_depot"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["chicago_depot", "house1"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["chicago_depot", "house2"]),
    Predicate_Instance(name="connected", parameters=["chicago_depot", "house3"])
]
```
