# Role
Your task is to estimate the initial state and the goal state for a PDDL problem based on a domain description and the available actions. Consider that if a predicate is checked by an action for an object, it should probably somehow be possible to make true or start true. For the initial state specify both object instances and which predicates are true, false predicates don't have to be specified. For the goal, specify the states which need to have specific values regardless if those are true or false. Do it step-by-step and explain your thoughts. Respond with the exact headings provided. You can't assume that any object, regardless of type, already exists. Everything you wish to use should be defined here. Also, remember that any symmetrical predicates likely should be defined both ways. 

First only define the object intances needed.

# Example
## Domain
The AI agent is here a scheduling system for a house construction company with administrators who can create orders, workers who perform them and vehicles to transport workers.

Currently, there are a couple of trucks at the Chicago depot and we're trying to build three houses in the area. Jamie is the only administrator, but we've got Emma and Bob available for general work. 

## Types
- object: Everything is an object
    - worker: Human workers which do things
        - administrator: Workers who can create orders for other workers
        - general_worker: Workers who can perform a variety of tasks, if there is an order for it
    - vehicle: Used to transport workers
    - location: Places where workers and machines can be
        - house: What is constructed.

## Predicates
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (which should be a worker or vehicle) is at location ?l
- (inside ?w - worker ?v - vehicle): true if the worker ?w is in the vehicle ?v
- (wall_order ?h - house): true if there is an order to build a wall at house ?h
- (wall_built ?h - house): true if a wall has been built for house ?h
- (floor_order ?h - house): true if there is an order to build a floor at house ?h
- (floor_built ?h - house): true if a floor has been built for house ?h
- (floor_order ?h - house): true if there is an order to build a roof at house ?h
- (roof_built ?h - house): true if a roof has been built for house ?h
- (finalized ?h - house): true if the house ?h has been completed. 
- (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): true if there is a road between l1 and l2 allowing travel between them.

## Object Instances
We assume that there are two trucks since the description said "a couple".
```
truck1 - the first truck at the Chicago depot
truck2 - the second truck at the Chicago depot
```

Next, let's define the relevant locations. Since "chicago_depot" is not a house, we model it as a general location.
```
chicago_depot - location: The Chicago depot
house1 - The first house to build
house2 - The second house to build
house3 - The third house to build
```

Now, let's model the worker.
```
jamie - administrator: The administrator Jamie
emma - general_worker: The first worker, Emma
bob - general_worker: The second worker, Bob
```


## Error
1. Are any necessary objects forgotten?
   The description states that there are "a couple of trucks". This entails that many trucks exist, but only two are defined. Add some more. Therefore: Yes. 

2. Are any un-necessary objects included?
   All the objects which are included are actually described and needed. So: No.

3. Are any objects defined as the wrong type?
   The "house" type is supposed to be used for what is being constructed, the houses built. However, "chicago_depot" is cleraly not being built by us, but is defined as a "house". It should be just a general location. Thereby: Yes.


Regenerate an entire response correcting the above error. Make sure to use the exact same headers as requested before.

## Response
The feedback is not entirely correct. Adding more trucks would be too large of an assumption, since the domain task only states "A couple". As such, we leave it with only two trucks.

Adding the starting location for Bob as well as removing the goal condition for truck1 is both correct however. I'll make those changes.

Now I'll reiterate the corrected initialization with the exact same headers.

## Object Instances
The feedback suggested to use more trucks, but this would be wrong since the domain only specifies "A couple". So, we stick with the two trucks.
```
truck1 - the first truck at the Chicago depot
truck2 - the second truck at the Chicago depot
```

The locations haven't been updated:
```
chicago_depot - location: The Chicago depot
house1 - The first house to build
house2 - The second house to build
house3 - The third house to build
```

The workers are unchanged from before:
```
jamie - administrator: The administrator Jamie
emma - general_worker: The first worker, Emma
bob - general_worker: The second worker, Bob
```
